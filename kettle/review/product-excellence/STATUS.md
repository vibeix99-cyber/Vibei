# Product Excellence — execution status (durable checkpoint)

Resume here after any interruption. Do not overwrite past verdicts; append.

## Authority and restore point

- **Authorized:** user execution authorization, 2026-10-07 ("BEGIN THE KETTLE PRODUCT EXCELLENCE BUILD").
- **Source of truth:** approved package `INTEGRATED-2026-10-06` (independent APPROVE 131/140; all 28 reviewed canonical hashes verified in preflight). Extracted locally at `kettle/.tmp/pkg/kettle-excellence-integrated/` (git-ignored; not app source).
- **Protected pre-rebuild restore point:** `8f1044a` (local annotated tag `pre-product-excellence`; the session's git proxy refuses tag pushes, so on the remote it stays reachable as an ancestor of the integration branch, which is never rewritten). Never reset or rewrite past it.
- **Integration branch:** `claude/wizardly-galileo-uy89d9`. Maker branches are local `pe/*` worktrees, merged only after an independent APPROVE.
- **Orchestrator / model:** Claude Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`, verified via session metadata). Makers, Checkers and the Final Product Boss are separate agent instances with their own context; a Checker never reviews work it built.

## Recovered state at start (revision 8f1044a)

- Working tree clean; `8f1044a` = `0532913` code (empty diff) + checkpoint commit.
- Accepted, preserved work (COMPLETE, protected by PRESERVE_LIST): round 6 implementation (`eeff3a0`), follow-up 1 (`0532913`: phone summary room, wrapping Home tags, record-player drawing → close-up).
- Checks at 8f1044a (from the follow-up-1 run): tsc clean · vitest 256/256 · Playwright e2e 29 passed / 2 skipped · core-loop checker 85/85.
- Contract states at start: **I01–I15 NOT STARTED** (no prior Product Excellence work exists).

## Contract board

| I03 Data safety, truthful storage consequences | P0 | M1 | IN PROGRESS | maker M1 running |
| I04 Access and short-screen reachability | P0 | M2 | IN PROGRESS | maker M2 running; gate: retest after all UI work |

| I15 Bounded comprehension check | P3 | M3 | NOT STARTED | only if I07/I08 comprehension stays uncertain |

## Waves and file ownership

| Wave | Maker | Contracts | Owns (exclusive while active) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | M1 Session and data integrity | I01, I02, I03 | `src/timer/**` (except `notify.ts`), `src/progress/**` (logic, not UI), `src/app/{flow,intention}.ts`, `src/lib/storage.ts`, `src/screens/settings/DataSection.tsx`, new tests |
| 1 | M2 Access and device quality | I04, I05, I14 baseline | `src/ui/**`, `src/styles/**`, `src/audio/**`, `src/timer/notify.ts`, a11y/layout fixes in `src/screens/**` other than M1's files, new tests and measurement tools |
| 2 | M3 Activation and progression clarity | I08, I07, I09 (+I13, I15 later) | `src/screens/{welcome,home,done,nook}/**` (copy/hierarchy), `src/scene/index.tsx` fallback |
| 2 | M4 Chai and calm feedback | I06 (+I10 later) | `src/art/**`, Chai asset pipeline |
| 3 | M5 Existing system and secondary utility | I11, I12 (if warranted) | `src/screens/{settings,stats}/**` |

## Tools

- Capture: `node review/product-excellence/tools/capture.mjs --base <url> --out <dir> --w <w> --h <h> --dpr <n> --theme light|dark [--rm] [--only ids]` (22 states, writes `capture-meta.json`).
- Dev servers: orchestrator 5191 (main checkout). Makers: M1 5201, M2 5202, M3 5203, M4 5204, M5 5205. Checkers 5211+.

## Log

- 2026-10-07: preflight passed; execution authorized. Package extracted to `.tmp/pkg`. Capture tool written and smoke-tested.
- BEFORE baseline complete (`d17dda1`): 135 captures, zero page errors; inspected by the orchestrator. Observed for
  later contracts: Home Brew length partly under the docked start at 390×844 and below the fold at 375×667 (I04);
  Home duration order Gentle 15 / Classic 25 / Deep 50 / Custom vs Settings preset order Classic / Deep / Gentle /
  Custom (I11 candidate); Chai masters are ~490 px tall, desktop Retina needs ~580 → 1.19× upscale; no genuinely
  higher-resolution approved masters exist (I06).
- Worktrees `/home/user/wt/m1` (`pe/m1`) and `/home/user/wt/m2` (`pe/m2`) created; makers M1 (I01–I03) and M2
  (I14 baseline, I04, I05) launched in parallel (machine: 4 cores, so two makers at a time).

## Exact next action

Wait for M1 / M2 READY FOR REVIEW → launch an independent Checker per submission → APPROVE/REJECT loop →
merge approved branches into the integration branch → regression → write Wave 2 briefs (M3: I08, I07, I09;
M4: I06) from the integrated revision.
